> Asset Pricing Factor Comparison in American and Chinese Stock Markets with Neural Networks

We conduct a comparative factor analysis through the neural network approach between the U.S. market and China market. The neural network bases upon a selected factor zoo, which has 30 veriﬁed and grouped factors. With neural networks, we successfully identify that the factors inﬂuence varies between the markets from the prediction of individual stock returns. A further discussion for the sub-groups is conducted from the portfolio-level prediction test. The factor importance rank also veriﬁes our study results.
